In Groupon’s new Super Bowl commercial titled “Who Wouldn’t,” 2017’s biggest breakout star is seen walking down a typical Main Street, asking the question: “what kind of person wouldn’t want to support local businesses?” The ad positions Tiffany as the smart, savvy consumer who uses Groupon every day to save money and help local businesses in her neighborhood––and feels good about doing so––against the soulless rich guy who fails to understand the value of supporting a family-run local business.\n    “We have a very funny concept that combines Tiffany’s trademark sense of humor along with her authentic enthusiasm for Groupon,” said Groupon’s Chief Marketing Officer Vinayak Hegde. “She was a natural at conveying our passion for building amazing communities through successful small businesses, and she’s a great fit for the big stage that is the Super Bowl.”\n    Haddish first popped up on Groupon’s radar during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. During the segment, which can be found on the show’s official YouTube channel, she hilariously describes how she took a certain Hollywood A-list couple on a Groupon for a swamp tour experience while filming the movie “Girls Trip” in Louisiana.\n    “Who Wouldn’t” will air on Feb. 4 during the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl. O’Keefe Reinhard & Paul handled the creative for the 30-second spot and supporting social and video campaign content, and Blackwood Seven is handling the media buy.\n    Groupon began introducing Tiffany earlier this month with an ad titled “Celebrity.” In the spot, Haddish addresses why her new-found status hasn’t diminished her desire to use Groupon. Groupon and Tiffany will continue to partner together on a campaign that will run beyond the Super Bowl, including a spot for Valentine’s Day.\n    Groupon and Tiffany are getting you big game-ready with a collection of deals on all the stuff you need to throw an amazing game watch party, top things to do in your neighborhood, relaxing salon and spa packages and mouth-watering restaurant deals.
