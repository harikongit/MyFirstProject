<h5 align="center"><b>Acquisition to power and enhance Groupon’s international online 
  discount code and loyalty programs</b></h5>
 
  <label >Groupon today announced it has acquired Cloud Savings Company, Ltd., parent company of online discount code platform Vouchercloud and brand loyalty provider Giftcloud, at an enterprise value of $65 million.
  “We’re pleased to add two great, profitable brands and very talented teams to the Groupon family,” said Groupon CEO Rich Williams. “In Vouchercloud, we’re acquiring one of the most innovative brands in the online discount codes space, which we believe will accelerate our own efforts — particularly in International — and broaden our marketplace for consumers. In Giftcloud, we see interesting long-term potential in creating attractive customer loyalty programs with some of the biggest names in retail, as well as with great local merchants.”
  For Vouchercloud and Giftcloud, the acquisition represents the opportunity to continue to develop 
  their growing businesses while benefiting from Groupon’s local expertise and significant customer 
  and merchant scale.<br>
  “We’re very excited for Vouchercloud and Giftcloud to join the Groupon family. We recognize the potential in combining our expertise in the coupon sector to enhance our offerings for consumers in the UK and beyond,” said Greg Le Tocq, co-founder and director of Cloud Savings Company. “In joining together, we can create even more — and more effective — ways for customers to save and businesses to grow. We equally look forward to working with Groupon to grow the Giftcloud business, as we continue to be at the forefront of innovation while the gift card industry moves from plastic to digital.”
  Groupon expects the deal to contribute $5 million to $6 million in Adjusted EBITDA in 2018.
  Vouchercloud operates in 11 countries — primarily in the United Kingdom — with more than 5 million subscribers and relationships with more than 12,000 top retailers and brands. Their mobile app has been downloaded more than 10 million times. Groupon intends to maintain the company’s Bristol headquarters where they employ approximately 100 people.

<h5 align="center"><b>“Girls Trip” star and Groupon super user explains how everyone (well, almost everyone) benefits from saving money and helping local businesses in their neighborhood</b></h5>
<label>As someone who ranks in the top one percent of most frequent Groupon purchasers, new company spokesperson and “Girls Trip” star Tiffany Haddish (@TiffanyHaddish) definitely knows a thing or two about saving money and helping local businesses in her neighborhood. In Groupon’s new Super Bowl commercial titled “Who Wouldn’t,” 2017’s biggest breakout star is seen walking down a typical Main Street, asking the question: “what kind of person wouldn’t want to support local businesses?” The ad positions Tiffany as the smart, savvy consumer who uses Groupon every day to save money and help local businesses in her neighborhood––and feels good about doing so––against the soulless rich guy who fails to understand the value of supporting a family-run local business.
    “We have a very funny concept that combines Tiffany’s trademark sense of humor along with her authentic enthusiasm for Groupon,” said Groupon’s Chief Marketing Officer Vinayak Hegde. “She was a natural at conveying our passion for building amazing communities through successful small businesses, and she’s a great fit for the big stage that is the Super Bowl.”
    Haddish first popped up on Groupon’s radar during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. During the segment, which can be found on the show’s official YouTube channel, she hilariously describes how she took a certain Hollywood A-list couple on a Groupon for a swamp tour experience while filming the movie “Girls Trip” in Louisiana.
    “Who Wouldn’t” will air on Feb. 4 during the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl. O’Keefe Reinhard & Paul handled the creative for the 30-second spot and supporting social and video campaign content, and Blackwood Seven is handling the media buy.
    Groupon began introducing Tiffany earlier this month with an ad titled “Celebrity.” In the spot, Haddish addresses why her new-found status hasn’t diminished her desire to use Groupon. Groupon and Tiffany will continue to partner together on a campaign that will run beyond the Super Bowl, including a spot for Valentine’s Day.
    Groupon and Tiffany are getting you big game-ready with a collection of deals on all the stuff you need to throw an amazing game watch party, top things to do in your neighborhood, relaxing salon and spa packages and mouth-watering restaurant deals. In addition, Tiffany has picked out some of her favorite Groupon categories to share with users. To view the full collection, please visit https://www.groupon.com/occasion/tiffany-haddish.
